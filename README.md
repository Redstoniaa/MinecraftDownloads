# Redstonia's House
https://redstonia2020.github.io/MinecraftDownloads/

A small official website by myself. I mainly use it to upload schematics and other stuff for Minecraft so that you can easily download them for use in your own worlds, however, I'm planning to put the website to more uses in the future.

Mobile support is not yet here, since I see no reason to be downloading schematics on your mobile phones (Litematica obviously doesn't work on mobile editions of Minecraft), however, once I add more features, mobile support will soon follow. (also I'm too lazy to design a layout for mobile)
